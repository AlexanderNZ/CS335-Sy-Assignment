============= Post Submission Update ==============

Assuming a clean install of any operating system, such as on a UoA lab computer,
You will need to:

Install nodeJS (which provides node package manager aka npm)
Install Bower
Install grunt-cli
You may also need to install Ruby, some operating systems come with it, some don't.

After that's been done, navigate your terminal of choice to the download directory, then run

npm install
bower install
grunt serve

This will install dependencies within the download directory and run the project.
